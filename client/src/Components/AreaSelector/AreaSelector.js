          Lively Gastown is known for its whistling Steam Clock and mix of
          souvenir shops, indie art galleries and decor stores in Victorian
          buildings. A trendy food and drink scene includes chic cocktail
          lounges and restaurants serving everything from gourmet sandwiches to
          local seafood. Hip eateries also dot the neighboring Downtown Eastside
          area, while the up-and-coming Railtown district is home to edgy
          fashion studios.
